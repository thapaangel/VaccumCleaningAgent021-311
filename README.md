Simulation (Python + Tkinter)
This repository contains a simulation of a Vacuum Cleaner Agent implemented in Python using Tkinter for visualization. The agent operates within a 2D grid-based environment and demonstrates multiple types of intelligent agent behaviors:

ðŸ’¡ Agent Types Implemented:
Utility-Based Agent: Chooses the next move based on a utility function that prioritizes cleaning dirty tiles and avoids revisiting already-cleaned tiles.
Simple Reflex Agent: Acts only based on the current tileâ€™s condition (dirty/clean) and moves randomly if the current tile is clean.
Goal-Based Agent with Memory: Tracks visited cells and targets the goal of cleaning all dirty cells using memory and directional logic.

ðŸ›  Built With
Python (3.x)
Tkinter â€“ for GUI graphics and animation
VS Code â€“ used as the development environment

ðŸ§  Features
Real-time animation of the agent cleaning the grid.
Configurable grid size and dirt probability.
Memory-aware decision-making in utility and goal-based agents.
Console logs showing agent movements and final cleaning summary.
