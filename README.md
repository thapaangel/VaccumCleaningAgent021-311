# LAB REPORT ON VACCUM CLEANING AGENT 
***
### Name: Aruna Thapa 
### CRN: 021-311
### Subject: Artificial Intelligence 
***
#### ABOUT
Simulation (Python + Tkinter) This repository contains a simulation of a Vacuum Cleaner Agent implemented in Python using Tkinter for visualization. The agent operates within a 2D grid-based environment and demonstrates multiple types of intelligent agent behaviors:

💡 Agent Types Implemented:
Utility-Based Agent: Chooses the next move based on a utility function that prioritizes cleaning dirty tiles and avoids revisiting already-cleaned tiles.

Simple Reflex Agent: Acts only based on the current tile’s condition (dirty/clean) and moves randomly if the current tile is clean.

Goal-Based Agent with Memory: Tracks visited cells and targets the goal of cleaning all dirty cells using memory and directional logic.

#### TOOLS USED
Python (3.x)
Tkinter – for GUI graphics and animation
VS Code – used as the development environment

### FEATURES
Real-time animation of the agent cleaning the grid.
Configurable grid size and dirt probability.
Memory-aware decision-making in utility and goal-based agents.
Console logs showing agent movements and final cleaning summary.
